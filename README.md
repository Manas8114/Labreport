This code is for a medical application that uses the Tkinter library for the GUI and MySQL for database operations. 
The application has multiple tabs for different medical tests like Hematology, Urine Examination, Biochemistry, etc.
Each tab has fields for entering test results. There are buttons for saving data to the database, printing entered data,
showing output, and displaying a chart. The application also has an output tab where the output is displayed. 
The application requires Python with Tkinter and MySQL connector libraries, and a MySQL database for storing the data.
The database schema should match the fields in the application.
So, requirments are:
pip install tk
pip install mysql.connector
pip install matplotlib
Create a mysql data base name hospital and change password and user name as per needs.
